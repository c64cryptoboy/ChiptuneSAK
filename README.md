ChiptuneSAK (swiss army knife) is a generalized pipeline for processing music and targeting various constrained playback environments.

It imports from many music formats and converts them to a common representation chirp (**CH**iptunesak **I**ntermediate **R**e**P**resentation).  Chirp can be processed and transformed in many ways, and then exported to various playback formats and environments.

## Background

Many one-off music processing tools were created for the Youd/Knapp/Van Haren [ten-Commodore Orchestrion](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/07/how-many-commodores-does-it-take-to-crack-a-nut/), as well as for processing the music format for user-contributed content to Unknown Realm (Note: we know nothing about the status of the game, so please don't ask).  Recently, Youd/Knapp/Brenner began work on a (not-yet-released) Commodore 64 Ultima-game music demo, requiring similar processing pipelines.

It became apparent that there were low-hanging opportunities to introduce generality into our workflow.  Therefore, these separate efforts have been redirected into this standalone tool / library.  Its workflow is inspired by the LLVM compiler framework, which accepts many programming languages, "raises" them to a common intermediate format that can be manipulated, then "lowers" the code to many target platforms.

## Team

* David Knapp
* David Youd
* Markus Brenner: Ultima music importing/exporting
* Hasse AxÉ™lsson-Svala: GoatTracker consultant

## Project Status

The code is currently in a pre-alpha state.  Features are being debated and fundamental data representations are in flux.  Currently working on a variety of concrete importers and exporters from which to generalize the processing pipeline.  Details:

### Music importers

* Standard [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/specifications) file (type 0 or 1):  Contains note on/off events in delta time
* [GoatTracker 2](https://sourceforge.net/p/goattracker2/code/HEAD/tree/): A Commodore 64 pattern-based music editor for Windows/linux/MacOS
* [GoatTracker 2 Stereo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goattracker2/files/GoatTracker%202%20Stereo/) (2SID)

#### Importers: under development

* Commodore 64 [SID files](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt): Arbitrary C64 code that plays music (minus the playloop), wrapped with metadata and well-defined entry points.  Will support PSID and some RSID.  Importer is proposed as alternative to the closed-source SID2MIDI.

#### Importers: proposed

* Subset of [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/for-developers/): A digital sheet music interchange format
* [MOD](http://web.archive.org/web/20120806024858/http://16-bits.org/mod/) (Amiga Module) files
* [NSF](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF) (Nintendo Sound Format).  We already have a pure-python 6502 emulator working for the C64 SID importer that can be reused.
* Many opportunities with VGM (Video Game Music)  -- a sample-accurate sound logging format for [many machines](https://vgmrips.net/packs/systems) and many [sound chips](https://vgmrips.net/packs/chips)
* COMPUTE!'s [Sidplayer](https://archive.org/details/Computes_Music_System_for_the_Commodore_128_and_64/mode/2up) [format](https://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~schepers/formats/SIDPLAY.TXT)

### ChIRp processing / transformations

* Quantizing of note onset and duration
* tick scaling, truncation, voice projection and reordering
* Arbitrary metric modulation with support for music with varying meters
* Transpose score
* Separate ("explode") polyphony into separate voices
* Music compression for trackers: compute patterns, including reused based on transposition and differing tempos

#### ChIRp processing: under development

* Additional tracker compression schemes

#### ChIRp processing: proposed

* tbd

### Music exporters

* MIDI
* [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation.pdf): Sheet music markup language
* [Commodore 128 BASIC](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/BASIC#Overview_of_BASIC_Version_7.0_Commands) music program
* GoatTracker 2 and GoatTracker 2 Stereo (2SID), both automatically compute patterns for smaller files
* ML64: Human-readable music format for [Unknown Realm](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stirringdragongames/unknown-realm-an-8bit-rpg-for-pc-and-commodore-64) music contributions from those supporting at the "bard tier"

#### Exporters: Under development

* [SID-Wizard](https://sourceforge.net/p/sid-wizard/code/HEAD/tree/) 1.8 (targeting dual and triple SID, as SID-Wizard only supports midi->single SID)

#### Exporters: Proposed

* Minecraft [Note Blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Note_Block)
* [Mario Paint Composer](https://mariopaintcomposer.proboards.com/)
* Markus's yet-unnamed Dr. Cat-derived 3-SID C64 player
* [ABC](http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1) Notation: Human-readable music format.  Used to allow user-submitted music in online games including Starbound, Lord of the Rings Online, and Shroud of the Avatar
* jellybiscuits [Music Box Composer](http://www.jellybiscuits.com/?page_id=951) file format
* A [Rob Hubbard engine](https://www.1xn.org/text/C64/rob_hubbards_music.txt)
* RobTracker v1.11 (publicly released Dec 25th. 2019)

## Recent milestones

* Exported some Monkey Island (MS-DOS 1990) midi capture into 2SID GoatTracker.  Patterns automatically computed to reduce file size.
* Created 6502 emulator for upcoming SID importer
* Exported some Betrayal at Krondor (MS-DOS, 1993) midi capture to pdf sheet music, goat tracker, and Commodore 128 BASIC program

## Requirements/Building

* [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * pip install
        * matplotlib
        * mido
        * more-itertools
        * numpy
        * parameterized
        * sphinx
* [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/download.html)
* [MidiEditor](https://www.midieditor.org/) - *optional, useful for visualizing what is happening to the midi files*

### Bootstrap: Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install lilypond python3-venv build-essential

# Convenience Make target for setting things up
make venv
source venv/bin/activate

## Or if you prefer setting things up manually, you might do something like:

# Make and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install ChiptuneSAK
pip3 install --editable .

# Install Python development dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
