# ChiptuneSAK

![logo](https://github.com/c64cryptoboy/ChiptuneSAK/blob/master/res/logoSmall.png)

ChiptuneSAK (**S**wiss **A**rmy **K**nife) is a generalized pipeline for processing music note data and targeting various constrained playback environments.

ChiptuneSAK can import music from many formats and converts it to a common representation called chirp (**CH**iptunesak **I**ntermediate **R**e**P**resentation).  Chirp can be processed and transformed in many ways, and then exported to various playback formats and environments.

## Background
In the past, we've written a number of one-off note data processing tools for previous projects (e.g. the  [ten-Commodore Orchestrion](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/07/how-many-commodores-does-it-take-to-crack-a-nut/), an Unknown Realm Bard midi->ml64 importer, etc.).  And with more similar projects on the way, it became apparent that there were opportunities to introduce generality and reusability into our processing pipelines.  Therefore, our separate efforts have been redirected into this library.  Its workflow is inspired by the LLVM compiler framework, which accepts many programming languages, "raises" them to a common intermediate format that can be manipulated, then "lowers" the code to many target platforms.

## Team

* David Knapp: core developer
* David Youd: core developer
* Ian Lee: python practices consultant

* We are particularly grateful to:
    * Hasse AxÉ™lsson-Svala: For offering up much-needed GoatTracker and GoatTracker stereo sample data
    * Markus Brenner: For providing an Apple II Mockingboard Ultima music import example in our framework


## Project Status

The code is currently in an alpha state.  Fundamental data representations have mostly stabilized.  We are currently working on a variety of concrete importers and exporters from which to continue to generalize the processing pipeline. These importers and exporters include:

### Music importers

* Standard [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/specifications) file (type 0 or 1):  Contains note on/off events in delta time format
* Commodore 64 [SID files](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt): C64 code that plays music (minus the playloop), wrapped with metadata and well-defined entry points.  ChiptuneSAK supports PSID and some RSID.  The importer is proposed as open-source alternative to SID2MIDI.
* [GoatTracker 2](https://sourceforge.net/p/goattracker2/code/HEAD/tree/): A Commodore 64 pattern-based music editor for Windows/linux/MacOS
* [GoatTracker 2 Stereo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goattracker2/files/GoatTracker%202%20Stereo/) (2SID)

#### Importers: under development

* TBD

#### Importers: proposed

* Subset of [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/for-developers/): A digital sheet music interchange format
* [MOD](http://web.archive.org/web/20120806024858/http://16-bits.org/mod/) (Amiga Module) files
* [NSF](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF) (Nintendo Sound Format).  We already have a pure-python 6502 emulator working for the C64 SID importer that can be reused.
* [SAP](http://asap.sourceforge.net/sap-format.html) (Slight Atari Player).  Atari 8-bit music file, again 6502-based.
* Many opportunities with VGM (Video Game Music)  -- a sample-accurate sound logging format for [many machines](https://vgmrips.net/packs/systems) and many [sound chips](https://vgmrips.net/packs/chips)
* COMPUTE!'s [Sidplayer](https://archive.org/details/Computes_Music_System_for_the_Commodore_128_and_64/mode/2up) [format](https://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~schepers/formats/SIDPLAY.TXT)

### ChIRp processing / transformations

* Quantizing of note onset and duration
* Tick scaling, truncation, voice projection and reordering
* Arbitrary metric modulation with support for music with varying meters
* Transposition
* Separation of polyphony into separate voices ("explode") 
* Music compression for trackers: identification and exploitation of patterns, including reuse with transpositions and differing tempos

#### ChIRp processing: under development

* Additional tracker compression schemes

#### ChIRp processing: proposed

* TBD

### Music exporters

* MIDI (type 1 files)
* [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation.pdf): Sheet music markup language
* [Commodore 128 BASIC](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/BASIC#Overview_of_BASIC_Version_7.0_Commands) music program
* GoatTracker 2 and GoatTracker 2 Stereo (2SID), both with optional pattern-based compression
* ML64: Human-readable music format for [Unknown Realm](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stirringdragongames/unknown-realm-an-8bit-rpg-for-pc-and-commodore-64) music contributions from those supporting at the "bard tier"

#### Exporters: Under development

* [SID-Wizard](https://sourceforge.net/p/sid-wizard/code/HEAD/tree/) 1.8 (targeting dual and triple SID, as SID-Wizard only supports midi->single SID)

#### Exporters: Proposed

* Minecraft [Note Blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Note_Block)
* [Mario Paint Composer](https://mariopaintcomposer.proboards.com/)
* Markus's yet-unnamed Dr. Cat-derived 3-SID C64 player
* [ABC](http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1) Notation: Human-readable music format.  Used to allow user-submitted music in online games including Starbound, Lord of the Rings Online, and Shroud of the Avatar
* jellybiscuits [Music Box Composer](http://www.jellybiscuits.com/?page_id=951) file format
* A [Rob Hubbard engine](https://www.1xn.org/text/C64/rob_hubbards_music.txt)
* Other tracker file formats, such as JCH's [SID Factory II](http://olivi.chordian.net/category/sid-factory-ii/)

## Requirements/Building

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/download.html)
    * Must be in your path (e.g., "C:\Program Files (x86)\LilyPond\usr\bin")
* [MidiEditor](https://www.midieditor.org/) - *optional, useful for visualizing what is happening to the midi files*

### Bootstrap: Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install lilypond python3-venv build-essential

# Convenience Make target for setting things up
make venv
source venv/bin/activate

## Or if you prefer setting things up manually, you might do something like:

# Make and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python development dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Install ChiptuneSAK in editable mode
pip3 install --editable .

# Run the unittests to make sure things are working as expected
python3 -m unittest discover -p "*Test.py"
```

### Bootstrap: Windows 10

The following instructions make the following assumptions:

* You installed [Python 3.8 from the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l)
* You are installing using Windows PowerShell or the Command Prompt

```ps1
# If PowerShell, run as Admin:

# Set Powershell Execution Policy to all running local scripts:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
# Answer "[A] Yes to All" when prompted
```

```ps1
# Compare your Python version to what was used writing this README
python --version  # Python 3.8.3

# Create a Python virtual environment (EXPLICITLY use `python` instead of `python3`)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate

# Install requirements in to virtualenv
pip install -r .\requirements.txt

# Install ChiptuneSAK in editable mode
pip install --editable .

# Run the unittests to make sure things are working as expected
tests\testall.bat
```
