This example shows how to convert the 2-voice song shown in the C128 BASIC manual to *correct* C128 Basic:

 1. Import the song to chirp format from a MIDI file, which already has 16th notes expanded to 8th notes
 3. Convert the song to mchirp format
 3. Save the BASIC as source
 4. Save the BASIC as a prg file
