Use of ChiptunesSAK requires a basic understanding of musical concepts; we will not attempt to inclue that here.

However, some key concepts are important to the understanding of music.

The simplest conception of music uses note durations that are powers of 2 of some basic beat.  For example, in Western (European) music, a whole note is made up of 2 half notes, 4 quarter notes, 8 eighth notes, or 16 sixteenth notes.  The note names themselves reflect this division.
