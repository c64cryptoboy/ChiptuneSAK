The simple factors-of-two rhythm scheme is inadequate. Even in Western music there exists a great deal of music that uses note divisions that are *not* powers of 2.  By far the most common grouping is of three notes.  For longer durations, this grouping can be accomplished using so-called dot notation: a dotted note is 1 1/2 times the equivalent undotted note; thus, a dotted half note is equal to three quarter notes. However, there are many situations in which groups of three are in music that is better suited to the powers-of two representation.  In these situations, a notation concept called *tuples* is used to represent groups of multiple notes that fill a single beat. By far the most common tuples are groups of three notes, called *triplets*. Tuplets of other numers of notes exist but are quite rare.

If a song is primarily comprised of factor-of-two rhythms, then the song is written in a *simple meter* (implying powers-of-two lengths) and triplets are appropriate. If the song is dominated by groups-of-three rhythms, then it is usually written in what is known as a *compound meter*, in which each beat represents three subdivisions instead of two.  Common compound meters include 6/4, 6/8, and 12/8 time signatures.

**Metric Modulation** is a technique that changes note duration types while still sounding the same, allowing music to meet the constraints that may be imposed by 8-bit chiptunes devices.

For example, music written in a simple meter can be converted to a compound meter. Chiptune engines frequently only support simple meters and require that all notes be powers-of-two lengths. Using metric modulation, music that contains tuples can be converted to music that obeys factor-of-two constraints.
