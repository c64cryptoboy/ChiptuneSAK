Base Tuning Frequency
---------------------


Pitches and Cents
-----------------

The Western music scale is made up of 12 evenly-spaced pitches. Humans hear pitch as the *logarithm* of the frequency, and an octave (made up of 12 equally-spaced steps, called *semitones*) is a factor of exactly 2 in frequency. Thus, a semitone is a frequency ratio of :math:`2^{1/12}`, or a factor of about 1.06.  Following this logarithmic pattern, musicians divide semitones into 100 equally-spaced ratios of :math:`2^{1/1200}`, called *cents*.  100 cents make up a semitone, so any frequency can be described by a note and an offset in cents, usually set up to range from -50 to +50.

**Note:** all musical notes and tunings are described by **ratios**, not by **differences**. A common mistake is to treat the difference between two notes as the *difference* in their frequencies. So, for example, you might think that the midpoint between an A4 (440 Hz) and B4 (493.88 Hz) is  :math:`(440 + 493.88) / 2 = 466.94` Hz. Thatn howwever, is incorrect.  The true midpoint is :math:`440 * 2^{(log_2(466.94) - log_2(440)) / 2} = 466.16` Hz.

Luckily, ChiptuneSAK has functions to take care of all the math for you.  So think of pitches as notes plus or minus cents.  This notation is very convenient.  For example, if a song is written with a tuning different from the standard 440 Hz, but is otherwise in tune, *all* notes will differ from their standard counterparts *by the same number of cents.*

C64: NTSC and PAL
+++++++++++++++++

American and European television standards diverged in the 1950s, with American and Japan using `NTSC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC>`_ and Europe using `PAL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL>`_. Ever since, a debate has raged about which is "better."  Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and ChiptuneSAK lets you work with whichever you prefer.

For the NTSC standard, the frame rate is supposed to be 60‚ÅÑ1.001 Hz, which is very close to 59.94 frames per second. The origin of this very strange refresh rate was the need for whole numbers for dividing the refresh rate in order to allow filtering of the color signal. The PAL frame rate is exactly 50 frames per second.

However, life is considerably more complex than you might think.  The standards allow for a certain slop in the frame rate; retro cumputer hardware generally did not produce frames at exactly the specification frequencies.  For example, the NTSC Commodore 64 produces frames at 59.826 Hz, determined by the main system clock frequency of
1.022727 MHz. Likewise, the PAL C64 frame rate is 50.125 Hz, from a system clock frequency of 0.985248 MHz.

As a result, music from identical music generation code will sound very different on the two architectures. For music written for a PAL system, the NTSC playback will be about 19% faster and the notes 65 cents higher.
