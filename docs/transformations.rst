Music Processing and Transformation in Chirp
============================================

Most basic music transformation and processing capabilities in the ChiptuneSAK are in the Chirp respresentation.  To perform these operations, music is imported and converted to the chirp representation.  The ChirpSong and ChirpTrack classes have a large number of pre-defined music transformation methods, and are designed to make addition of new methods quite simple.
