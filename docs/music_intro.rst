Music Introduction
------------------

Use of ChiptunesSAK requires a basic understanding of musical concepts; we will not attempt to include a primer on music or musical notation.

However, some key concepts are important to the understanding of music and how ChiptuneSAK processes it.

The simplest conception of music uses note durations that are powers of 2 of some basic beat.  For example, in Western (European) music, a whole note is made up of 2 half notes, 4 quarter notes, 8 eighth notes, or 16 sixteenth notes.  The note names themselves reflect this division.
