# Classes for SID processing (SID header parsing, SID note extraction, etc.)
#
# SidDump class:
#    Playback details for PSID/RSID ("The SID file environment")
#    - https://www.hvsc.c64.org/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt
#
#    Has some support for RSIDs.  From sid documentation concerning RSIDs:
#    "Tunes that are multi-speed and/or contain samples and/or use additional interrupt
#    sources or do busy looping will cause older SID emulators to lock up or play very
#    wrongly (if at all)."
#
#    siddump.c was very helpful as a conceptual reference for SidImport:
#    - https://csdb.dk/release/?id=152422
#    siddump has an option for "frequency recalibration", where a user specifies
#    a base frequency for better note matching (different from the siddump frequency
#    tables that were set to 440.11 tuning if running on a PAL).
#    Instead, we've implemented NTSC/PAL-specific automated tuning detection (by sampling
#    some or all notes in a subtune).  And instead of fixed frequency tables, we derive
#    tuning and architecture-based frequencies at runtime.
#
# SidImport TODO:
# - print warning if jmp or jsr to memory outside of modified memory

            #     PC: 3e86 sp: 02 instr: 40 RTI
            # This wrapped the stack all the way to x05.  This is a low-fidelity emulation, and
            # the 256-byte stack was initialized to zero, so the PC gets set to $0000
            #     PC: 0000 sp: 05 instr: 00 BRK
